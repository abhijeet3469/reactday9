react-router-dom is module which handles routing.

hooks:-
useParams:- is used to looking data in url. In our React app sometimes we want to access the parameters of the current route in this case useParams hook comes into action.
 
useState:-  it stores previous values untill unless it is updated. The React useState Hook allows us to track state in a function component. when we update the useState by using function, in the backend it is re-rendering. Whenever we update a particular state, it re-render and in useEffect if we write a call back function and no dependencies, each time it renders and useEffect will be working.

useEffect:- The useEffect Hook allows you to perform side effects in your components.
Some examples of side effects are: fetching data, directly updating the DOM, and timers.
useEffect accepts two arguments. The second argument is optional.
useEffect(<function>, <dependency>)
